The basic game is in Linux folder!

I made another version for Windows since Python supports sound only
for windows without installing extra modules!

Fullscreen mode is also os dependent

Important key points

- Use arrow keys to turn bike

- You can save the game only in singleplayer mode and when loading game,
 you can start always from the same score you left off even if you lose
 after loading game

- Leaderboard does not show your time if it is slower than 1.99 seconds
  or any other top 5 time

- Use "b" key in case your boss comes

- Try not to pause the game or it gets angry at you and does not want to
  close as fast as usual

- If you have entered your own keys you can reset them by restarting the game

Have fun with your friends in the multiplayer

 - Default keys are for the blue bike "wasd" and for the orange "arrow keys"

DO NOT CHEAT

- Timer is not working in cheat mode
